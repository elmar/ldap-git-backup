Description: Back up LDAP database in an Git repository
 ldap-git-backup (creates and) updates a Git repository which contains the
 current LDIF dump of an LDAP directory.  Given that writes are rare in an LDAP
 directory and confined to a few entries for each write Git will store the
 entire history of an LDAP directory in a space efficient way.
 .
 By default the backups are done with slapcat from OpenLDAP but can be done
 with any command that dumps the current contents of an LDAP directory in LDIF
 format.
